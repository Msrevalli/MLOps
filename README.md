# MLOps

### **What is MLOps?**  
MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices that combines **machine learning (ML), DevOps, and data engineering** to automate and streamline the lifecycle of ML models, from development to production and monitoring.  

MLOps ensures that machine learning models are **reliable, scalable, and reproducible** while maintaining efficiency in deployment, monitoring, and governance.

### **Key Components of MLOps**
1. **Data Management** ‚Äì Handling data collection, cleaning, labeling, and versioning.  
2. **Model Development** ‚Äì Experimentation, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering.  
3. **Model Versioning & Tracking** ‚Äì Keeping track of different versions of ML models.  
4. **Model Deployment** ‚Äì Deploying models into production environments (APIs, edge devices, cloud).  
5. **Monitoring & Performance Tracking** ‚Äì Tracking model drift, data drift, and ensuring model fairness.  
6. **Automation & CI/CD for ML** ‚Äì Automating ML pipelines for faster deployment using tools like Kubeflow, MLflow, and Apache Airflow.  
7. **Security & Governance** ‚Äì Managing compliance, explainability, and access control for ML models.
